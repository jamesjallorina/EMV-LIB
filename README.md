# FinTech Utility

FinTech Utility is a collection of financial technology utilities written in C 98 and C++ 98


## Summary

These are a collection of utilities that may help everyone on the field. May it be issues that need to investigate or a code snippet that they want to incorporate in the production code.

So, why C and C++? I think C and C++ are two main programming languages that are used in creating high-performance applications that process hundred to thousands of transactions per second.

It is also the core language mainly used in the financial applications. Using C/C++, you may find a lot of tools in Unix/Solaris/AIX, etc. A lot of these tools have become mature like the gnu utilities.

Codes are written in C 98 and C++ 98 since these are stable and available versions in mentioned OS'es.
